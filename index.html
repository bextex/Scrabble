    <p>The first player combines two or more of his or her letters to form a word and places it on the board to read
      either across or down with one letter on the center square. Diagonal words are not allowed.
      <br><br>Complete your turn by counting and announcing your score for that turn. Then draw as many new letters as
      you played;
      always keep seven letters on your rack, as long as there are enough tiles left in the bag.
      <br><br>Play passes to the left. The second player, and then each in turn, adds one or more letters to those
      already played to
      form new words. All letters played on a turn must be placed in one row across or down the board, to form at
      least one
      complete word. If, at the same time, they touch others letters in adjacent rows, those must also form complete
      words,
      crossword fashion, with all such letters. The player gets full credit for all words formed or modified on his
      or her
      turn.
      <br><br>words may be formed by:
    <ul>
      <li> Adding one or more letters to a word or letters already on the board.</li>
      <li>Placing a word at right angles to a word already on the board. The new word must use one of the letters
        already on the
        board or must add a letter to it. (See Turns 2, 3 and 4 below.)</li>
      <li>Placing a complete word parallel to a word already played so that adjacent letters also form complete
        words. (See Turn 5
        in the Scoring Examples section below.)</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>No tile may be shifted or replaced after it has been played and scored.
    <br><br>Blanks: The two blank tiles may be used as any letters. When playing a blank, you must state which letter it
    represents.
    It remains that letter for the rest of the game.
    <br><br>You may use a turn to exchange all, some, or none of the letters. To do this, place your discarded letter(s)
    facedown.
    Draw the same number of letters from the pool, then mix your discarded letter(s) into the pool. This ends your
    turn.
    <br><br>Any play may be challenged before the next player starts a turn. If the play challenged is unacceptable, the
    challenged
    player takes back his or her tiles and loses that turn. If the play challenged is acceptable, the challenger
    loses his
    or her next turn. Consult the dictionary for challenges only. All words made in one play are challenged
    simultaneously.
    If any word is unacceptable, then the entire play is unacceptable. Only one turn is lost on any challenge.
    <br><br>The game ends when all letters have been drawn and one player uses his or her last letter; or when all
    possible plays
    have been made.</p>
